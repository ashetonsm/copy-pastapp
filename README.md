# Copy-Pastapp

Resume parsers make mistakes sometimes, so I made an app to make copying and pasting information from a resume easier. (You know, when you inevitably have to correct everything.)

### To do:
- [x] Add formatting option(s) (e.x. adding/removing bullets)
- [x] Delete copiable elements
- [x] Drag to combine copiable elements
- [ ] Save/load lists
- [ ] Automatically remove excess spaces/tabs/erroneous characters
- [ ] Finish styling
