# Copy-Pastapply

Resume parsers make mistakes sometimes, so I made an app to make copying and pasting information from a resume easier. (You know, when you inevitably have to correct everything.)

### To do:
- [x] Add formatting option(s) (e.x. adding/removing bullets)
- [x] Delete copiable elements
- [x] Drag to combine copiable elements
- [x] Save/load lists
    - [x] Ask if the user would like to overwrite if a list is saved with an existing name.
- [x] Update current list when items are combined or removed (in addition to when "Copyify!" is clicked)
- [ ] Add touch support for most browsers
    - [ ] Add touch support for Safari
- [ ] Refine text formatting options
- [ ] Implement read from file
    - [ ] PDF
    - [ ] TXT
    - [ ] DOCX
- [ ] Finish styling
